# Computer Science Unity Visual Aid
 A visual aid for computer science concepts and datastructures using the Unity game engine.
 
 Lerp and Slerp demo automatically begins playing on start and loops indefinitely.
 
 Stack and Queue demo uses inputs:
 - 'W', 'UpArrow' and 'LeftMouseButton' to push the stack/queue simultaneously
 - 'S', 'DownArrow' and 'RightMouseButton' to pop the stack/queue simultaneously
 
 Basic sorts demo uses inputs:
 - 'Space' and 'LeftMouseButton' to execute the next swap in the algorithm
 
 
 
 TODO (Updated Jan 11, 2020):
 - Upgrade to a newer version of Unity to utilize more up-to-date GUI features to add proper in-simulation text and value updates.
 - Add textures to to nodes being sorted to indicate comparisons happening in the background. (Change texture and yield while comparing?).
